<P> The black tablet is a kind of ultimate wisdom energy body extracted from pure consciousness. No matter how it is measured, its ratio is 1:4:9. It exists out of the body and can travel freely through the universe. </P> 
<P> The black square tablet represents a higher level of civilization. It first appeared at the beginning of the movie. In front of the ape man's cave, an ape man picked up an animal skeleton and smashed it onto other skeletons on the ground. It represents that the ape man learned to use tools and civilization began to evolve. </P>
